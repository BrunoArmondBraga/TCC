%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% INSERINDO COMENTÁRIOS EM ARQUIVOS .bib %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% 1. Como em outros arquivos LaTeX, comentários são iniciados por "%" e,
%    portanto, é preciso usar "\%" para imprimir o caractere "%". Esquecer
%    disso pode gerar erros difíceis de encontrar!
%
% 2. Não é possível inserir comentários dentro de uma entrada, apenas fora.
%
% 3. Não é possível incluir o caractere arroba em um comentário.
%
% 4. Se quiser desabilitar temporariamente um campo ("comentar" o campo),
%    troque seu nome para algum nome inválido, como "author-disable".
%    Se quiser fazer alguma observação permanente dentro de uma entrada,
%    você também pode usar algum nome de campo inválido, como "lembrete",
%    ou usar o campo "annotation", que normalmente é ignorado.
%
% 5. Se quiser desabilitar temporariamente uma entrada inteira ("comentar" a
%    entrada), não basta colocar "%" nas linhas correspondentes por causa do
%    caractere arroba; também é preciso remover a arroba.
%
% 6. Na verdade, as regras não são bem essas, mas segui-las é uma boa ideia:

@article{rotation_distance,
title = "Rotation distance, triangulations, and hyperbolic geometry",
abstract = "A rotation in a binary tree is a local restructuring that changes the tree into another tree. Rotations are useful in the design of tree-based data structures. The rotation distance between a pair of trees is the minimum number of rotations needed to convert one tree into the other. In this paper we establish a tight bound of 2n – 6 on the maximum rotation distance between two n-node trees for all large n. The hard and novel part of the proof is the lower bound, which makes use of volumetric arguments in hyperbolic 3-space. Our proof also gives a tight bound on the minimum number of tetrahedra needed to dissect a polyhedron in the worst case and reveals connections among binary trees, triangulations, polyhedra, and hyperbolic geometry.",

Under a reasonable model of computation, a method is given to perform offline linear search in amortized cost proportional to the entropy of the request sequence; and so, this cost is at most logarithmic. On the other hand, any online technique is subject to linear amortized cost for some sequences. It follows, then, that no online technique can have an amortized cost of that which one could obtain if given the request sequence in advance, i.e., there is no competitive linear search algorithm.",

abstract = {Lichtenstein proposed the use of a "planar" version of 3SAT as a departure point for proofs of NP -completeness that would at once prove the general graph problem as well as its restriction to planar graphs to be NP-complete. Dyer and Frieze later proved that Planar lin3SAT is also NP-complete. Of the three standard versions of 3SAT, only NAE3SAT remained open. We provide a very simple reduction from NAE3SAT to Simple MaxCut, which respects Lichtenstein's conditions; since it is known that the planar version of (Simple) MaxCut is in P, so is the planar version of NAE3SAT, thereby setting the question (if in a somewhat unexpected way).},

publisher = {Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated},
edition = {5th},
abstract = {This standard textbook of modern graph theory, now in its fifth edition, combines the authority of a classic with the engaging freshness of style that is the hallmark of active mathematics. It covers the core material of the subject with concise yet reliably complete proofs, while offering glimpses of more advanced methods in each field by one or two deeper results, again with proofs given in full detail. The book can be used as a reliable text for an introductory course, as a graduate text, and for self-study. From the reviews: This outstanding book cannot be substituted with any other book on the present textbook market. It has every chance of becoming the standard textbook for graph theory. Acta Scientiarum Mathematiciarum Deep, clear, wonderful. This is a serious book about the heart of graph theory. It has depth and integrity. Persi Diaconis \& Ron Graham, SIAM Review The book has received a very enthusiastic reception, which it amply deserves. A masterly elucidation of modern graph theory. Bulletin of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications Succeeds dramatically ... a hell of a good book. MAA Reviews A highlight of the book is what is by far the best account in print of the Seymour-Robertson theory of graph minors. Mathematika ... like listening to someone explain mathematics.
